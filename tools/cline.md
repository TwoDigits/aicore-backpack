## Description

Cline is an open-source autonomous coding assistant by Cline Bot Inc. that works across VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, and Windsurf. Its core value proposition is full model flexibility: because it's open source, you can plug in any AI model—Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, local models via Ollama/LM Studio, or anything behind an OpenAI-compatible API. No vendor lock-in.

With 57.5k+ GitHub stars and 5M+ installs, it's trusted by enterprises including Samsung, Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon.

## Key Features

- **File Management**: Creates and edits files with diff preview; monitors for linter/compiler errors
- **Terminal Execution**: Runs commands directly in VS Code's integrated terminal and reacts to output
- **Browser Automation**: Launches browsers, clicks elements, types text, captures screenshots and console logs for testing
- **MCP Integration**: Uses Model Context Protocol to create and install custom tools tailored to workflows
- **Plug in Any Model**: Open-source architecture means no lock-in — supports OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, Vertex AI, Cerebras, Groq, and local models (LM Studio/Ollama)
- **Plan/Act Modes**: Structured dual-mode workflow — Plan mode maps out the approach, Act mode executes it
- **Context Attachments**: Reference files, folders, URLs, and problems with `@url`, `@problems`, `@file`, `@folder`
- **Checkpoints**: Workspace snapshots for comparison and restoration
- **Cost Tracking**: Token and API cost tracking for usage transparency

## Why It's Cool

Being fully open source is Cline's biggest differentiator in the AI coding space. While most alternatives lock you into a single model or provider, Cline lets you swap models freely — use Claude for one task, switch to a local Llama model for another, or wire up any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. That flexibility, combined with human-in-the-loop approval for every file change and terminal command, makes it a practical choice for teams that want agentic AI without sacrificing control or transparency.

## Getting Started

1. Install via your IDE's extension marketplace — supported on VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, and Windsurf
2. Configure your preferred AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, local model via Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API)
3. Open the Cline panel and start working
4. Use Plan/Act modes to structure complex tasks
