## Description

BMad Method (Build More, Architect Dreams) is a comprehensive AI-driven development framework that orchestrates 21 specialized AI agents across 4 modules to manage complete software development lifecycles. It provides structured, battle-tested workflows powered by agents who understand agile development methodology.

The framework adapts intelligence levels based on project scope - from quick bug fixes to enterprise systems - providing guided workflows for planning, architecture, and implementation phases.

## Key Features

- **Scale-Adaptive Intelligence**: Automatically adjusts planning depth based on project complexity
- **21 Specialized Agents**: PM, Architect, Developer, UX Designer, Test Architect, and more
- **50+ Guided Workflows**: Organized across 4 development phases
- **Three Development Tracks**:
  - Quick Flow (< 5 min) for bug fixes
  - BMad Method (< 15 min) for products/platforms
  - Enterprise (< 30 min) for compliance-heavy projects
- **Document Sharding**: Claims 90% token savings for large projects
- **Multi-Language Support**: Separate settings for communication and code
- **Web Bundle Export**: Works with ChatGPT, Claude Projects, and Gemini Gems
- **Customizable Agent Personas**: Adjust expertise levels and personalities

## Why It's Cool

BMad Method addresses a critical gap: generic AI assistants lack domain expertise in agile development. Instead of starting from scratch with every project, this framework provides structured workflows and role-specialized agents that understand software development methodology. It reduces cognitive load by having dedicated agents for each role (PM, architect, developer, tester) and scales from individual contributors to enterprise teams without requiring you to reinvent the wheel each time.

## Getting Started

**Installation:**
```bash
# v6 Alpha (recommended)
npx bmad-method@alpha install

# Stable v4
npx bmad-method install
```

**Usage:**
1. Run `*workflow-init` in your IDE to analyze project requirements
2. The system recommends an appropriate workflow track
3. Follow phase-based guidance:
   - **Analysis**: Requirements gathering and scope definition
   - **Planning**: Project structure and timeline
   - **Solutioning**: Architecture and design decisions
   - **Implementation**: Development with agent guidance
