## Description

Agent OS is a system designed to enhance AI coding agents by providing structured workflows and specifications. It captures development standards, technology stack details, and codebase-specific information to give AI agents the guidance they need for higher-quality code generation on initial attempts rather than through multiple iterations.

Created by Brian Casel of Builder Methods, Agent OS addresses a common pain point: AI coding agents often produce code that requires multiple revisions before being production-ready. By structuring how agents receive project context, standards, and requirements, Agent OS enables more consistent, high-quality results.

## Key Features

- **Universal Compatibility** - Works with Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI coding tools
- **Flexible Scope** - Applicable to new projects and existing codebases alike
- **Language Agnostic** - Supports any programming language or framework
- **Scalable Approach** - Useful for large features, minor fixes, and intermediate tasks
- **Spec-Driven Development** - Structured specifications guide AI agents to better outputs

## Why It's Cool

Developers using AI coding agents often face a frustrating cycle of revisions and corrections. Agent OS tackles this by creating a structured layer between your project requirements and the AI agent. Instead of repeatedly correcting the AI's output, you provide comprehensive specifications upfront that guide the agent toward production-ready code on the first attempt. With 2.8k+ stars and 500+ forks, it's gained significant traction in the AI-assisted development community.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the documentation at [buildermethods.com/agent-os](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os) for complete setup instructions
2. Clone or reference the repository structure in your project
3. Configure specifications for your technology stack and coding standards
4. Integrate with your preferred AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
