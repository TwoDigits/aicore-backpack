## Description

CodeLayer is an open-source IDE designed to orchestrate AI coding agents for solving complex problems in large codebases. Built on Claude Code, it provides keyboard-first workflows and advanced context engineering capabilities that scale AI-first development across entire teams without quality degradation.

Created by Dex Horthy and the HumanLayer team (who coined the term "Context Engineering"), CodeLayer represents their vision of how developers should interact with AI coding agents in production environments.

## Key Features

- **Keyboard-First Workflows**: Optimized for developers prioritizing speed and control, similar to Superhuman for email
- **Advanced Context Engineering**: Scales AI-first development across teams while maintaining quality
- **Multi-Claude Support**: Run parallel Claude Code sessions, including worktrees and remote cloud workers
- **Battle-Tested Workflows**: Pre-built workflows that enable AI to solve hard problems in large, complex codebases
- **Open Source**: Built on Claude Code and fully open source under Apache 2.0

## Why It's Cool

CodeLayer addresses the challenge of using AI coding agents effectively in large, real-world codebases. Rather than simple "vibe coding" approaches that work on greenfield projects, it focuses on solving hard problems in complex existing systems. The team behind it pioneered concepts like "Context Engineering" and "12-Factor Agents", making this tool backed by deep expertise in production AI systems.
