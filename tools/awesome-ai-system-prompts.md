## Description

Awesome AI System Prompts is a comprehensive repository containing system prompts from various production AI tools and agents. It serves as a reference for developers and prompt engineers who want to understand how successful AI systems are built and configured. The repository includes prompts from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, v0, Bolt.new, same.new, Cline, Cursor, Manus, Grok, Loveable, and more.

Beyond just collecting prompts, the repository analyzes patterns and principles that make these prompts effective, providing valuable insights into production-level prompt engineering.

## Key Features

- **Multi-platform Coverage**: System prompts from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, v0, Bolt.new, Cline, Cursor, Manus, Grok, and more
- **Structured Organization**: Directories for each AI tool with detailed prompt files
- **Pattern Analysis**: Documentation analyzing eight foundational principles for effective agentic prompts
- **Real-world Examples**: Production-level prompts demonstrating proven implementations

## Eight Foundational Principles

The repository identifies these core principles for effective agentic prompts:

1. Clear role definition and scope
2. Structured instructions using headings/tags
3. Explicit tool integration guidelines
4. Step-by-step reasoning frameworks
5. Environment and context awareness
6. Domain-specific expertise constraints
7. Safety and refusal protocols
8. Consistent tone and interaction style

## Why It's Cool

This repository goes beyond simple prompt storage by revealing how production AI systems actually work. You can see how v0 uses MDX components, how same.new enforces strict schema adherence, and how Manus implements explicit agent loops. Understanding these architectural patterns helps you build more reliable and predictable AI assistants. It's essentially a masterclass in prompt engineering from the best AI products in the industry.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to explore the prompts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dontriskit/awesome-ai-system-prompts.git
```

Browse the directories for each AI tool to find their system prompts. Start with the README for an overview of common patterns and principles, then dive into specific tools you're interested in learning from.
