## Description

Claude Code Tresor is a curated ecosystem of production-ready utilities designed to augment Claude Code with professional-grade capabilities. It provides 141 specialized agents organized into color-coded teams, covering the complete development lifecycle from project scaffolding and code review to testing, documentation, security auditing, and deployment validation.

The collection includes autonomous skills that work in the background, slash commands for workflow automation, and expert agents for specialized tasks - all validated and documented to production standards.

## Key Features

- **141 Specialized Agents**: 8 core production-ready agents (systems architect, security auditor, test engineer, etc.) plus 133 subagents across 10 team categories
- **19 Slash Commands**: Split between development, orchestration, and workflow automation
- **8 Autonomous Skills**: Background processes that enhance your workflow automatically
- **Security & Compliance**: Intelligent orchestration for security audits, vulnerability scanning, and compliance checks
- **Performance Tools**: Profiling, benchmarking, and optimization capabilities
- **Deployment Validation**: Health monitoring and deployment verification
- **Multi-Language Support**: Covers 16+ programming languages
- **Quality Validated**: 100% YAML validation across all agents with 9.7/10 quality rating

## Why It's Cool

This is like getting a full development team of AI specialists pre-configured for Claude Code. Instead of building custom prompts and agents from scratch, you get battle-tested tools for security auditing, performance profiling, code review, technical debt analysis, and more. The modular installation lets you pick exactly what you need, and the comprehensive documentation makes it easy to integrate into existing workflows.
